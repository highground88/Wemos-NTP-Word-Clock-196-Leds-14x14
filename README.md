# 196 LED / 14x14 Word Clock

Heavily based on Bizit524's excellent code! : https://github.com/bizit524/WordClockEnglish

Modified for a 196 LED / 14x14 layout with a few vertically running words.

This is working, but I have a few small issues I need to fix or get assistance with:

 1. Having a slight flicker of a few words (positions 195,194 & 187,186) which seems to be timing related? (changing the delay value changes the flicker)
 2. The word "O'CLOCK" and "TWELV" seem to stay up constantly ....
