# 196 LED / 14x14 Word Clock

Heavily based on Bizit524's excellent code! : https://github.com/bizit524/WordClockEnglish

Modified for a 196 LED / 14x14 layout with a few vertically running words.

This is working, but I have a few small issues I need to fix or get assistance with:

 1. Having a slight flicker of a few words due to overlapping letters / 'if' statements.
