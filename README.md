Heavilly based on Bizit524's code! : https://github.com/bizit524/WordClockEnglish

Working, have a few small issues I need to fix or get assistance with:

 1. Having a slight flicker of a few words (positions 195,194 & 187,186) which seems to be timing related? (changing the delay value changes the flicker)
 2. The word "O'CLOCK" and "TWELV" seem to stay up constantly ....
